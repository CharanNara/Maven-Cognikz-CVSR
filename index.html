	<hr>
    <center><p>A maven (also mavin) is a trusted expert in a particular field, who seeks to pass knowledge on to others. The word maven comes from Hebrew, via Yiddish, and means one who understands, based on an accumulation of knowledge and skilled in any field .
Cognikz is a text speech format of cognizant which emphasizes on learning, perception and reasoning. Hence, by coalescing these two words we labeled ourselves as skilled personnel who are in quest of acquiring more and in-depth knowledge and having fun with it
The main motto  is to improve the personality development of students and to bring out the hidden talents of each of them in any field, also give career guidance.
In this academic year we have introduced a new event called “Talent Exhibition” .It is a great way to exhibit the talents of students.

Participating in a “Talent Exhibition” gives all students recognition for non‐academic talents. It also provides character‐building lessons during try‐outs, practice and performance. </p></center>
